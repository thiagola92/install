Scripts to use after restoring my computer.  

# usage

> [!TIP]  
> Remove lines from the script that you don't consider useful in your new computer.  

## Linux

```shell
bash install.sh
```  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Don't execute bash with sudo, the script will use sudo when needed.  
> This means that it may ask for password in some cases.

.\install.bat

> [!CAUTION]  
> Windows still needs a lot of manual setup, read the script for more information.
